Nagios Configuration
====================
The 'notes' field for host definition in Nagios needs to match the following example:
  latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136
If you are editing Nagios configuration files by hand this is how the FULL notes line should look like:
  notes latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136
You can get the precise coordinates from Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) - right click on 
the spot where your device is located and select option "What's here?". The coordinates will be set 
in maps search bar. 

To draw connections, hosts need to have 'parents' field set up with only one (!) hostname (for now).

Do not use ';' in any part of the Nagios config file. Try to avoid tabulators - use white spaces
instead. You can try to use NagMap with semicolons and tabulators, but this is not guaranteed to work. 

Apache / Nagmap setup
=====================
Your webserver (e.g. Apache) needs to have PHP support enabled!

1) copy the directory into your Apache web folder
   (/var/www/ on Debian/Ubuntu, or /var/www/html on RedHat/CentOS)

2) edit config.php file to fit your needs

3) Open the website of nagmap installation (e.g. open Firefox - point to http://www.youwebserver.org/nagmap )

When nothing works open the source code of the website (Ctrl-U in Firefox) and send to maco@blava.net for support :)
